# BatterySaverApp

I designed this app to go with an arduino project of mine. The goal of this app is to manage an external charge controller.
It communicates via bluetooth with a microcontroller, that enables or disables the charger for the phone, in an attempt to conserve battery life

# NB
This app is **NOT** going to work standalone. It **NEEDS** the rest of the project to work. I might upload it someday, if I have time.
